# NLP-Amazon-Food-Review

The purpose of this analysis is to make up a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a review is positive or negative. In this analysis, I didn't focus on the Score, but only on the positive/negative sentiment of the review. 

To do so, I worked on Amazonâ€™s review dataset, built a Term-doc incidence matrix using term frequency and inverse document frequency ponderation. When the data was ready, I loaded it into predicitve algorithms.
